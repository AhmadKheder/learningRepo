Let's talk a littel bit in those case's details

1. Challenges 
  You know that everyone face challenges in coding or math and you always get stuck in it
untile you conclude that it's impossble and you are incapable  of solving it, __STOP THINKING & ACTING LIKE A FIXED MINDSET__

All you have to do is to face the problem with a new strategy like, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When you are ready, walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until you start to see another way forward. I also recommend you to think out loud, that will lead you to find the root causes of your problem.

2. Obstacles

A coworker talked about “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” It’s the idea that we’ll do just about anything other than the actual task at hand if it has suddenly become challenging, and especially when there are so many tempting diversions – articles, videos, email, social – mere clicks away.

You also get stuck in the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it. His solution is to stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired.
Then you can keep going on with your project bit by bit until you get it done

3. Effort

The concept of “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” applies to procrastination in efforts you have to do, but you  feel better when you do it

here, you have to ask yourself 

   1. is this really what I want to do?
   1. Am I giving up too easily? 
   1. Would I rather shower off pangs of regret, or the sweat of accomplishment? .
  
 4. Criticism
  
  in this part make some notes about things you did it badly do, you do not do it again, which is a self-criticism

and taking into consideration criticism from coworkers

then ask yourself a couple of questions:
  1. Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
  2. What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
  
  
  5. Success of others
Be sure that your colleagues are dedicated with a passion for learning and you are a part of their company and it is easy to adopt the growth mindset concepts to influence peer interactions.
We can choose to be more transparent or more helpful than might be required or than we’re used to. 


## Growing at work, and outside work too

Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it.We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.


 remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of your abilities – if you just stay with it. A growth mindset opens you up to more creativity and possibility, and 
 you discover you are able to achieve more and set higher goals.
