   * Design theory 
   * Design tips      
   * How to organize information 
   * How to understand the audience

when you are almost  to build a website you have to ask **WHAT, WHY,HOW and WHO** many times and everywhere  


# Who is the Site For?
where you have specify the __individuals or Companies Target Audience__ depending on their info



# Why People Visit YOUR Website

These are the triggers making them come to the site no:
+ Key motivations
    - looking for general entertanment
    - looking for a specific goal 
        +  what is it in detail  
    - the value of your website in their opinion

# What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
you want to create a list
of reasons **why** people would
be coming to your site.


# What Information Your Visitors Need

 You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively

*Will they be familiar with the product / service information you are covering or do they need background information on it?* 

*What are the most important features of what you are offering?*


# How Often People Will Visit Your Site

# WireFrames

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require

# Getting your message across using design

The primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.

### CONTENT
Web pages often have a lot of
information to communicate.
For example, the pages of
online newspapers will have
information that does not appear
on every page of the print
equivalent


### Prioritizing

Create something
known as a visual hierarchy
to help users focus on the key
messages that will draw people's
attention, and then guide them
to subsequent messages


### Organizing

Users should be able to
identify the purpose of each
block without processing each
individual item.


*Let's look at an example of how design can be used to effectively communicate the services of a company*

1. visual hierarchy 
    - Attention is immediately drawn
        to a picture that shows the
        service this company offers
        and a headline to explain it. The
        size and colored background
        reinforce that this is the primary
        message on the page
2. Grouping
    - There are several chunks of
       information on this page.
        At the top you can see the logo
        and navigation. Under this is the
        information that introduces the 
        company's services.
        Further down are three distinct     
        groups showing you what the
        services do, the costs involved
        and some of the services' users   

3. Similarity 
    - The four points (at the bottom
        left of the screenshot) are all
        presented in a similar manner
        with consistent headings and
        icons        




# Designing Navigation
Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles.


# Summary

+ It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

+ Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
+ Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page 
+ Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them

+ You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style. 
+ You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
