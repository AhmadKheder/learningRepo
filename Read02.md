# Text Editor

A [text](https://ahmadkheder.github.io/-learning-journal/text)  editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store,
and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and
its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users
or to other programs). 
 Text editors can be used to enter program language source statements or to create documents such as technical manuals.
 
 **As a developer Text editor means to you:**
 
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

*Here is the general features that help you enjoy coding:*
+ code completion
+ syntax highlighting
+ nice variety of themes
+ ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.


### Another feature you should definitely look into is called *syntax highlighting*.
__Syntax highlighting:__ is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read



### Third-Party Options
Ok, what about third-party options? Let’s talk about software
like:
__*Notepad++*, *Text Wrangler*, *BB Edit*,*[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) MY BEST*,*Atom*,
*Brackets*, and *Sublime Text*__. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today
