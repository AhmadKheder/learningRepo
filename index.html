                <p> <h2>Overview</h2>
                    Cod liver oil and fish oil are two different health supplements. They come from different fish sources and have unique benefits. Generally speaking, though, cod liver oil is a specific type of fish oil.

The health benefits of both fish oil and cod liver oil come from their high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids support many body systems and may prevent a number of ailments. The human body can’t make its own omega-3 fatty acids, which is why you need to include them in your diet.

The fatty acids in fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These omega-3 fatty acids are the “good oils” that everyone needs to include in their diet.

Some plant sources (such as nuts, seeds, and vegetable oil) contain another kind of omega-3 fatty acid, called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). This hasn’t been proven to be as beneficial as the fatty acids from fish oils.

If you don’t eat two to three servings of (nonfried) fish per week, you may benefit from taking fish oil or cod liver oil supplements.
